### Explanation of the App

The app takes user input through a series of prompts to set the parameters for a desired password and prints them for you in a box.
I utilized JavaScript to build the functions to generate the password as well as traversing the DOM and targeting functions built in to the browser.

### Acknowledgment

Help along the way definitly Youtube, and Google. hours, and hours it seems.
Again like last project hats off to Alex Fleming.  
Having him "driving" and explaining what he is thinking has helped a lot, this project more with using the variables we've set and not mispelling or calling them at wrong times etc.

#### DISCLAIMER

I take no responsibility for any of the passwords generated.
